# Task 07.01: Deliver Quote Create Flow

## Business Requirements

### Problem
The new catalog experience is incomplete unless the user can add their own quotes into the local collection. KindWords needs a create flow that validates quote input clearly and saves user-authored quotes with the required local metadata.

### User Story
As a user, I want to write and save my own quote so that KindWords can store personal motivation alongside the bundled catalog.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] From the Quote Catalog, the user can start quote creation from the add action in the app bar and from the floating action button.
- [ ] In create mode, the Quote Form allows entry of quote text, optional author, and 0 to 3 predefined tags.
- [ ] Saving a valid new quote stores it locally with source `userCreated` and with required fields `id`, `text`, `author`, `tags`, `source`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
- [ ] The form rejects quote creation when quote text is blank or fewer than 10 characters and shows visible field-level validation.
- [ ] After a successful save, the user returns to an updated quote collection that includes the newly created quote.

### Business Rules
- Only predefined tags are selectable in this release.
- The create flow must not allow more than 3 selected tags.
- The quote source is shown as read-only information rather than something the user can choose.
- Create behavior remains fully offline and local to the device.

### Out of Scope
- Editing an existing quote.
- Deleting an existing quote.
- Favorites screen entry into the form.

## Technical Guidance

### Architecture Notes

**Axis:** Form state lifecycle — the decisive problem is managing local form state (controllers, validation) separately from app state (provider), with proper coordination at submit time.

**Pattern: StatefulWidget with GlobalKey<FormState>**

`QuoteFormScreen` must be a `StatefulWidget` because it owns:
- `TextEditingController` instances for quote text and author fields
- `GlobalKey<FormState>` for validation triggering
- `Set<String>` of selected tags (local UI state, not provider state)

Do NOT use `StatelessWidget` — form controllers require lifecycle management via `dispose()`.

**Create mode only — no `quote` argument**

This task implements create mode only. The `QuoteFormScreen` constructor should not require a `Quote? quote` parameter yet. Edit mode is task 07.02.

**Form fields and validation**

| Field | Widget | Required | Validation |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| Quote text | `TextFormField`, `minLines: 4`, `maxLines: null` | Yes | Non-empty, ≥10 characters |
| Author | `TextFormField`, single line | No | None |
| Tags | `Wrap` of `FilterChip` | No | Max 3 selectable |

Validation must be inline / form-based using `TextFormField.validator` — do NOT use snackbar-only error display. Call `_formKey.currentState!.validate()` on Save tap.

**Source handling**

Source is implicitly `userCreated` for create mode. Display it as read-only info (per UI spec: `Icons.edit_note` + `"Your own quote"`). The source field is NOT user-editable.

**ID generation strategy**

User-created quotes require deterministic unique IDs. Use:
```
id: "user_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}"
```

This is dependency-free (no `uuid` package required) and produces a stable, sortable identifier.

**Tag selection logic**

- Tags are selected from the predefined set already defined in `quote_catalog_screen.dart` (`_kPredefinedTags`).
- `#personal` is **selectable, not auto-required** — per SRS §8.3, a quote may have 0–3 tags. The UI spec line 157 ("auto-selected") is superseded by this planning note.
- When 3 tags are selected, remaining unselected chips must be disabled.
- Consider extracting a reusable `_TagSelector` widget if the chip logic exceeds ~30 lines.

**Navigation and result handling**

After successful save:
1. Pop with result `true`: `Navigator.of(context).pop(true)`
2. Catalog screen receives result via `await Navigator.push(...)` in both AppBar `+` and FAB handlers
3. If result is `true`, call `context.read<QuoteCatalogProvider>().load()` to refresh

Do NOT call provider mutation inside field callbacks. All persistence happens in the Save button's `onPressed` handler, after validation passes.

**Catalog screen modifications**

Add to `QuoteCatalogScreen`:
- `AppBar.actions`: `IconButton(icon: Icons.add, onPressed: _navigateToCreate)`
- `Scaffold.floatingActionButton`: `FloatingActionButton.extended(icon: Icons.add, label: "New Quote", onPressed: _navigateToCreate)`
- Private method `_navigateToCreate()` that pushes `QuoteFormScreen` and handles result

### Affected Areas

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `lib/screens/quote_form_screen.dart` | **New** — StatefulWidget with form, controllers, tag selector |
| `lib/screens/quote_catalog_screen.dart` | Add AppBar `+`, FAB, navigation result handling |
| `lib/providers/quote_catalog_provider.dart` | Already has `createQuote()` — no changes needed |
| `lib/models/quote.dart` | Already supports v2 fields — no changes needed |
| `test/screens/quote_form_screen_test.dart` | **New** — widget tests for validation and save |
| `test/screens/quote_catalog_screen_test.dart` | Add tests for FAB/create navigation |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Verification |
|------|--------------|
| Create entry point visible | AppBar `+` icon and/or FAB present on catalog screen |
| Save blocked when invalid | Save button disabled until form valid; `validate()` returns false for text <10 chars |
| Valid form creates user quote | After save, quote with `source: userCreated` exists in provider list |
| Catalog shows new quote | After return from form, new quote visible in catalog list |
| Tag limit enforced | Selecting 3 tags disables remaining chips |
| Author optional | Form accepts empty author field; saves with `author: null` |
| No edit-mode UI | No `quote` constructor argument, no edit-specific UI elements |
| Lint clean | `flutter analyze` exits 0 |
| Tests pass | `flutter test` exits 0 |
| Changelog updated | Entry under `## [Unreleased]` describing create flow |

### Gotchas

1. **Catalog reload timing** — Do NOT call `load()` in `setState` or `didChangeDependencies`. Only reload after `await Navigator.push(...)` returns `true`. Calling reload too early or unconditionally will cause unnecessary DB reads or race conditions.

2. **Provider mutation in field callbacks** — Resist the temptation to update provider state in `onChanged` handlers. All persistence must happen in the Save action, after validation passes. Early mutation creates partial-state bugs.

3. **`#personal` auto-required assumption** — The UI spec suggests auto-selecting `#personal` for user quotes, but SRS §8.3 explicitly allows 0 tags. Follow SRS: `#personal` is selectable, not forced. Forcing it would violate "0–3 tags" business rule.

4. **StatelessWidget for form** — Using `StatelessWidget` will cause controller disposal leaks and lose form state on rebuild. Must use `StatefulWidget` with `dispose()` override for controllers.

5. **Edit-mode scope creep** — Do not add `quote` parameter, `isEditMode` flag, or update/delete logic. Those belong in task 07.02. Create-only keeps the commit atomic and reviewable.
